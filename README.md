# MoreCompanyFork
This fork of MoreCompany adds simple features related to cosmetics. They allow for more freedom and accuracy in cosmetic-making.

## Features (compared to the base mod)
- Cosmetics can be attached to any bones (`CosmeticInstance.boneName`)
- Supports cosmetics scaled to the original player prefab from the game (instead of the player model from notnotnotswipez's template) (`CosmeticsInstance.scaledToPlayerPrefab`)

## Credits
Big loves to notnotnotswipez, the (main?) developer of MoreCompany. Adding a cosmetic system as part of a bigger lobby mod was an excellent idea. Thanks for making it open-source too.

As demanded in the Readme of the MoreCompany repository, I will not publish a build of this fork on any mod-hosting website. If you want it, download the codebase and build it yourself.
